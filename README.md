This plugin adds a command that literally does nothing.

**WAIT, before you stop reading: this plugin still has a real use case!** It
allows you to disable system-hotkeys by mapping them to the `Nothing: Do
Nothing` command. This way, you can for example disable the `⌘Q` hotkey on
macOS, so you never quit Obsidian again!

## Installation
For now, the plugin is still in beta. It can be installed with the [BRAT Plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

When published, it is going to be available in Obsidian's Community Plugin
Browser via: `Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Browse` → Search for _"Nothing"_
